## What I’m doing now

I’m working on this personal website that provides the outlet for my thinking and creativity. 

Key topics at the moment: 

- Systems thinking
- Networked thought

I’m working remotely during coronavirus delivering technical governance and Design Authority support for Major Infrastructure Projects at Babcock, Devonport. 

I’m still into trail running and am consistently intermittent fasting (20:4). Wim Hof and cold baths and showers are great too. 

My kids (1, 5, and 7) are full of beans and there is never a dull moment. 

Still loving Devon and Dartmoor as much as ever. What a wonderful part of the world to live.
