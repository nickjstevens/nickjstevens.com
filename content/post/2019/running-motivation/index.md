Never, ever give up

## Quotes

> Run when you can, Walk if you have to, Crawl if you must; Just never give up — Dean Karnazes

> Whether you think you can, or whether you think you can't, you're right — Henry Ford

> When you don't give up, you cannot fail

> Life isn’t about how you survived the storm, it’s about how you danced in the rain

> You're braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think — Winnie the Pooh

## Mantras

Failure is not an option

Never, ever give up

Just do it

Toughen up

Never stop trying

You never lose until you give up

Be brave, be strong

## Tips

**Smile** - Love the race, love the pain. You're never fully dressed without smile!

**Relax** - let the muscles relax, let the eyes close, relax the face completely, zone out

**Belief** - the training has got you this far, now the belief will take you to the finish. You are stronger than you think you are.

**Fly** - be efficient, flow, fly, remember that feeling of flying with no effort when you were young

Think of a time when I felt unstoppable, that feeling of elation, achieving that goal. Pride. Visualise the finish line, the emotions, achieving the goal.
