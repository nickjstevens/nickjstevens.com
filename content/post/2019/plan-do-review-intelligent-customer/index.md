There are numerous “decision cycles”, as outlined on [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_cycle), including the famous Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) from the quality bible ISO 9001, but I favour a simple 3-step model of **Plan-Do-Review**. I feel like the “Act” of PDCA is really a “Do” in disguise and therefore should be preceded by a Plan and then go into the Do loop for a continuous cycle. In other words PDCA feels like the “Acting” to make a change is done without Planning, if that makes sense...

There is of course the simple truth that word triplets are biologically easy to remember and occur throughout literature:

- The three wise men
- The holy trinity
- The three musketeers
- Morning, noon and night
- Trouble comes in threes
- Three’s a crowd
- Goldilocks and the three bears
- ... the list could go on and on...

So I’ll happily stick to my **Plan-Do-Review** to make simple and meaningful progress at work and in life.

I’m also struck by the alignment with the trio from ONR’s Intelligent Customer capability in [NS-TAST-GD-049](http://www.onr.org.uk/operational/tech_asst_guides/ns-tast-gd-049.pdf) simplified to Specify-Oversee-Accept. 

I’ve sketched out the alignment below which I think is a powerful continuous cycle and expresses to me the equal importance of all three steps if you want to get **Intelligent Results**.
