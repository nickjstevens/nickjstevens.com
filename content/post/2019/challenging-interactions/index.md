Some days will be harder than others. People and difficult interactions will come to challenge us. We must see things for what they are, remain calm, and detach from our ape brain.
This passage from [Meditations by Marcus Aurelius](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations) on this very matter is so accurate, present and grounding that its astonishing to think these words were written nearly 2000 (!) years ago. Honestly, just think about that for a moment - 2000 years ago - and yet we’re still the same ape in civilised clothing, fighting our inherent urges.

> "When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly.
They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own — not of the same blood or birth, but of the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine.
And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him.
We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions." — Marcus Aurelius
