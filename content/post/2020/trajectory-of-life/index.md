Birth. From nothing to something. A spark in the darkness. Unknowable potential. After birth it’s like an explosion of consciousness. Of colour. A Big Bang on a smaller scale. An expansion to fill the void, consuming every experience, seeking every emotion, more, more, faster, bigger. An acceleration of experiences. Unquenchable curiosity. We look ever outwards, we look to others to validate us, our ego grows. We feed off others and off experiences. Maximal velocity. Life is a blurring rush. Standing still would be maddening. The speed, wind in your hair. Yeehaw!

Then at some point there is a turning point, an inflection. Perhaps this occurs when you have your own kids and realise that nothing else matters. Or perhaps when you realise you don’t give a fuck about what other people think. Or perhaps when you are faced with the starkness of your own mortality. The shift.

Then a realisation that it’s not all an outwards expansion, but the journey of life is now shifting inwards. An exploration of the self. Who are you? What do you want to be? How will you be remembered? It’s a contraction. A convergence. Now it’s about inner meaning and purpose. Unlearning instead of learning. Removing the unnecessary with the clarity of knowing what is unnecessary. Simplification. Time and perspective to smell the flowers and watch the birds. Consumption replaced with observation. You wondered why it ever mattered what other people thought. That was a different you. The trajectory continues inward. And as you explore deeper into you, your purpose, your meaning, it leads to, well, nothing. There is no you, no self, no ego. Your entire consciousness collapsed to a singularity. The same singularity when we were born from nothing. Existence. To non-existence. You are nothing, but everything. You are indistinguishable from the universe.
