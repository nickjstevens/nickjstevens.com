I’m the Assistant Chief Engineer within the Strategic Infrastructure business unit of Babcock International Group in Devonport. I’m currently working establishing engineering design processes that are commensurate with the scale of major new facility design projects and applying independent governance on technical outputs. My background is in finite element analysis, but more generally I am a problem solver, critical thinker and thought leader. I also have this website to share things I’ve learnt in engineering, finite element analysis, business and life.
